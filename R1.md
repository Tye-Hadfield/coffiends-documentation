### PURPOSE

Our client, the Brisbane Coffee Society (BCS) has requested for us to build a website to connect coffee drinkers with cafes for fast coffee ordering and pickup.

According to the client:

"Sometimes, getting your desired coffee when you need it can be very difficult. Queues to order and waiting while coffee is made takes up precious time, and the endless food and menu option trawling options of existing sites/apps takes too long. We want a simple site that enables us to order and pickup our favourite coffee quickly from nearby cafes."

The "Coffiends" website will address this gap in the market. It will target coffee serving cafes and coffee drinking customers. Cafes will be signed up (by BCS) and provide their coffee menu and prices. Customers will be able to buy coffees based on their preferred coffee type. Coffee orders will be sent through to the cafe for fulfilment for customers to pick up at a time of their choosing in the next 30 mins. The website is intended to provide a very quick and simple coffee ordering process for customers and additional business for cafes.

### FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES

Core features:

- Cafe search map using geolocation
- Ordering
- Cafe/menu/coffee CRUD & filtering
- Admin management
- Email notifications
- Purchasing

Desirable:

- user ratings
- more than just one coffee purchasing
- loyalty program

#### User Authentication/Authorization

The website will have a user management system for signup/login/logout. There will be three distinct roles - users, cafes and admins. User authentication and authorization will be used for security and role-based site access restrictions, making sure users are who they purport themselves to be and cafes can only access their own details while admins can access all cafes.

#### Cafe/Menu/Coffee CRUD Management

Cafes will need to be setup in order to sell coffee through the site. A cafe will be added to the website by an administrator. Admins will then provide sign-in details to cafes so they can access the dashboard, setup their menu and view orders. The list of all cafes can be seen by admins, who can filter the list by cafe name, and they have access to edit cafe details or delete cafes.

Cafes will be able to create and edit their menus by selecting a coffee type and setting its price. Menus consist of coffee types and prices. Coffees can be added to or deleted from menus.

Site coffee types are controlled by administrators. They can view, create and delete the coffee types used on the site.

#### Cafe Map & Ordering

On loading the website, customers will be asked to select the type of coffee they are looking for. The coffee they select and their geolocation coordinates are used to populate of their location with cafes that offer that coffee type who have signed up to the app. Customers can check the prices of each cafe marked on the map, and decide how far they are willing to walk to pick up their coffee or how much they are willing to pay. Once they have decided, they will select the cafe they want to order from and be asked for their coffee specifics (milk/sugar/size). From there they enter, their name and email/phone and are redirected for payment.

#### Payment

Payment for the coffee is handled by a third party to remove the website from being in scope for PCI compliance. Customers will be directed to a Stripe page connected to the cafes account that will process the payment using credit card details.

#### Notifications

Email notifications will be sent to customers to confirm payment was successful and the order was received by the cafe. Cafes will receive emails when a new order comes in.

#### Order Management/Cafe Dashboard

Cafes will have a dashboard when they login showing active orders and a link to view recent orders. Active orders will consist the coffee type & specifics, the order name and phone, the time it is to be ready by and have a check box/button to be used when the order is complete. When new orders come in, cafes get a notification email, and a sound/alert pops up on the site as well.

### TARGET AUDIENCE

It's for people who drink coffee. Particulalry people who want coffee fast. Which is everybody. Everybody who drinks coffee. Because they consume caffeine they want things fast.

The website is targeted at people who drink coffee. In particular, it's targeted at people who know what coffee they want and want it without fuss or queues. The time-poor and caffeine-desperate.
